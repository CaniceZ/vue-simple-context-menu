### About

Just a super simple context-menu. Had some trouble with some other libraries that didn't close the menu like you'd expect, so I made this.

### Usage Example

```html
```

### Props

### SASS Structure

```sass
```

### Development

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run watch

# build your demo page for production
npm run build:example

# pack your component/library with bili for publishing to npm
npm run build:lib

# publishing your component/library to npm (Check your version first before publish.)
npm version patch
npm publish
```
